# Custom Serialization Project

## Overview
This project implements custom serialization in Javascript, inspired by a [TikTok video by Uma Abu](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMrrGjdGv). It allows data to be stored with a unique file extension and encrypted, ensuring data security and integrity.

## Serialization
Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted and reconstructed later. Common formats include JSON, XML, and binary.

### Impact of Serialization
Serialization enables:
- **Data Persistence**: Saving objects and data structures for future use.
- **Data Transmission**: Sending data over networks efficiently.
- **Interoperability**: Sharing data across different platforms and applications.

### Use Cases
- **Applications like Adobe Premiere Pro**: Manage project files and settings.
- **Large Companies (Google, Microsoft, Amazon)**: Data storage and user state maintenance across devices.
- **APIs**: Transmitting structured data between clients and servers.

### Importance
- **Security**: Serialized data can be encrypted, as demonstrated in this project.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces data size for transmission.
- **Consistency**: Ensures data integrity across different environments.

## Project Details
- **Custom File Extension**: Data is serialized into a file with a unique extension.
- **Encryption**: Data is encrypted, requiring the correct key for decryption.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/preciousaffiah/Serialization.git
